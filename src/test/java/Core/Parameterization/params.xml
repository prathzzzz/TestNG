        1. TestNG allows running multiple tests concurrently using the `thread-count` attribute in
           the `<suite>` tag of the TestNG XML file.
        2. The `parallel="tests"` attribute specifies that the tests should be run in parallel, where
           each `<test>` tag runs in its own thread.
        3. The `thread-count` attribute determines the maximum number of threads TestNG can create to
           execute tests in parallel. In the provided XML configuration, `thread-count="5"` means up to
           five tests can execute simultaneously.
        4. This is particularly useful for reducing test execution time, especially when testing
           across multiple environments or browsers.
        5. It's important to ensure thread safety when parallelizing tests, such as using separate
           instances of `WebDriver` for each test thread.

        By combining parameterization and multi-threaded execution, we can efficiently test
        applications in various configurations and environments with minimal code duplication.
